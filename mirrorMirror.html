                <p>
                    What would you say if I told you you were ugly? Just walked up to you on the street and told you that you’re ugly.
                    <br><br>
                    Would you get angry?
                    <br><br>
                    Would you swear at me? Call me names? Hit me?
                    <br><br>
                    Would you get upset?
                    <br><br>
                    Would you run off crying? Ask me what’s wrong with me, and how I could be so mean?
                    <br><br>
                    Maybe you would just brush me off. After all, I’m just some nut on the street who’s bothering you.
                    <br><br>
                    What if I was a friend of yours and said the same thing? It would hurt a lot more I’m sure. We all know that those closest to us are the ones that can hurt us the most. It’s true for many reasons. We trust them more, we value their opinion more than that of a stranger, we open ourselves up to them because we have faith that they won’t hurt us.
                    <br><br>
                    Maybe they should.
                    <br><br>
                    Here’s the painful truth. We’re all ugly.
                    <br><br>
                    We all have inside of us that ugly, wretched little creature that thrives on our negative emotions. Our hate, our envy, our jealousy, our self pity, our anger, our selfishness, our pride.
                    <br><br>
                    I admit it. I’m ugly too.
                    <br><br>
                    A friend of mine passed a tryout that I spent years preparing for, and I felt like I wasn’t even noticed. I got jealous. I was mad. All I had wanted for years was to pass that tryout!
                    <br><br>
                    I was teased throughout middle school for being short, and quiet. I was embarrassed, hurt.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve failed tests, assignments, been rejected by girls, cut off by friends, lectured by disappointed parents and then wallowed in self pity because my life was so horrible.
                    <br><br>
                    Sometimes it seems that way, like everyone dislikes you, you’re not good enough or funny enough. You’re not popular enough, or successful enough. You’re not good looking, you’re too fat, or short (in my case). You’ve got too many pimples, or you wear ugly glasses.
                    <br><br>
                    It can be pretty depressing being filled with all those negative thoughts all the time.
                    <br><br>
                    As far as your appearance goes, most things are outside of your control. Feeling sad or guilty about things you have no control over, like your height, your complexion or whether or not you had braces for years, is ridiculous. If you let things that can’t be changed weigh you down, you’ll spend your whole life sinking.
                    <br><br>
                    I get it, it would be great to be tall, dark and handsome. Unfortunately, I’m short, white and had two rows of teeth as a kid. Was I embarrassed? Not about the teeth I wasn’t. I thought I was one cool shark. As for the rest of it, I’ve accepted who I am, and stopped letting other people’s opinions make me feel bad about myself. Try it sometime. It’s liberating.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve also had friends tell me I’m developing a beer belly. I’m 22 years old, and I care a lot about how I look. Did I get depressed? Nope, I went for a run, cut out the junk food, and started getting back into shape. Instead of being insulted, we should rely on our friends to let us know when we need a wake up call.
                    <br><br>
                    The true value in good friends is their ability to show us the sides of us that need improving, not flatter us endlessly like a magic mirror.
                    <br><br>
                    Don’t get offended from criticism, even if it’s rude, uncalled for or makes you want to cry.
                    <br><br>
                    Words are wind, let them blow by you.
                    <br><br>
                    If you’re wise, you’ll take each criticism as an opportunity to look inwards, and reexamine yourself.
                    <br><br>
                    He said I’m annoying? Maybe I talk too much, when I should be listening. Why do I keep getting rejected? Maybe I’m asking out the wrong kind of person or trying to get the wrong job. My friends stopped hanging out with me? Maybe I should make more of an effort to spend time with them.
                    <br><br>
                    All of these have happened to me, and I’m sure that at least some have happened to you. Instead of blaming others, we need to be willing to improve ourselves. We’re not perfect, though our pride disagrees.
                    <br><br>
                    We have so much to learn, but we can only do it if we’re prepared to listen to the truth. Honesty hurts. Sometimes is cuts deeply, but with the pain it brings awareness and self improvement. Lies cover over the blemishes while they rot and fester letting our pride delude us into thinking that we’re perfect. Too much sugar coating will make you sick. Honesty is the only way to stay healthy.
                    <br><br>
                    Embrace your flaws, and fix them. Accept your mistakes and learn from them.
                    <br><br>
                    Be honest to those you care about, but do it gently, and hope that they care about  you enough to be honest in return.
