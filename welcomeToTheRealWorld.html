                <h1>Welcome To The Real World</h1>
                <p>
                    The world as we see it, is like a dream world. So many things we accept as true are lies, delicately fabricated by so many people for so many different reasons.
                    <br><br>
                    There are the lies we tell ourselves, the ones that deep down we know can’t possibly be true, and often don’t make any sense. But we tell them anyways, because sometimes lies are what make us feel better about ourselves. They give us things to strive for that are attainable, instead of trying to achieve things we might fail at.
                    <br><br>
                    Take for example the lies we start telling ourselves as kids. “If Mom will just buy me that ice cream, then I can finally be happy.” or maybe it’s that new Gameboy you so desperately had to have. As kids, we’re constantly moving from one desire to the next. From the candy to the movie, to the shiny blue bike in the store window. We’re never satisfied. As adults, we know how pointless that way of living is. We tell kids to be happy with what they have, that always wanting more will only lead to constant disappointment.
                    <br><br>
                    Amazingly though, when it comes to our lives, we turn around and act exactly the same way. It’s different for every person, but most of us have that one thing that we just have to have in order to be happy. We lie to ourselves, even though we know in our hearts that those things don’t really give us what we’re looking for.
                    <br><br>
                    Next, there are the lies we tell each other. The ones we tell friends, family and even strangers. From the simple things like “you look great today” or “I’m doing well” when you’re really having a terrible day, to the bigger lies like telling a new partner you love them when you’ve barely been dating a few months. These lies we tell out of fear. We’re scared of hurting other people. We’re scared of having to deal with that hurt, with all those messy emotions. We’re scared of having to tell the truth both because we’re afraid of the truth about ourselves, and because we’re just so concerned with everyone else’s opinion of us. As if telling a lie really fixes any of our problems. All lies do is pad on another layer of makeup to cover the blemishes underneath, while we hope they go away.
                    <br><br>
                    Last, and worst of all, are the lies that the world tell us. Each and everyone of us, each and every day. They tell you that you can’t start that business, because it doesn’t exist yet, so clearly it’s not a good idea. How do they know? Have they tried it? Every startup is a new idea or a new way of thinking about an old idea. There’s no profit to be found in doing things exactly the way as they’re already being done. They say you can’t possibly get enough coverage for that product you want to sell, because you’re on such a short budget. Have they heard of Facebook? Twitter? MySpace? Blogs? The freaking Internet!? Information is spreads at a rate that we never would have dreamed of, and they dare tell you that you won’t get publicity if you don’t spend a lot. The list goes on and on.
                    <br><br>
                    So what’s my point? Why am I writing all of this? Do I want you to just give up? Of course not!
                    <br><br>
                    I’m here because I see a world full of opportunities. A world where only you can ensure that you lead a happy and successful life, and only if you’re willing to leave behind all the lies that the people around you have been telling you your whole life. Don’t be mad at them. They were lied to too. These lies have been told for as long as the human race has existed. Every unsuccessful, unhappy person probably believed some of those lies, and told some themselves.
                    <br><br>
                    Here’s your chance to break out of the mold. To take off the blindfold that has kept you in the dark for so long. It’s your chance to finally be the master of your own future. To make the right decisions knowing which will lead you to your goals, and which are made out of ignorance.
                    <br><br>
                    This is the moment where you take things in to your own hands, come what may.
                    <br><br>
                    Blue pill or red pill?
                    <br><br>
                    Like everything from here on out, it’s your choice.
