                        There are two kinds of people in the world, those who rule their pessimism, and those who let their pessimism rule them.
                        <br><br>
                        Everyone is a pessimist.
                        <br><br>
                        Whether it’s because your glass of beer is half empty, or you never reached for the sun because you were certain you’d get burned, we’re all pessimists at one point or another. 
                        <br><br>
                        Now of course you’re going to say to me <q>but Jeremy, I’m just being realistic</q>.
                        <br><br>
                        Well sorry guys, realism is an excuse. A way for everyone to tell you why you can’t do something incredible that they’ve never thought of.
                        <br><br>
                        It’s society’s way of saying <q>you can’t invent a solar powered rocket that delivers candy to the children of the world</q> because that’s too big a dream. <q>Don’t be unrealistic</q> they tell you, before sending you to build practical things out of Lego.
                        <br><br>
                        That’s what realism is. Realism is the dream killer of the young and the old, the creative and the ambitious. It’s what stops us from trying to be great, from daring to leave the boundaries of what is accepted.
                        <br><br>
                        Every great inventor started of as a dreamer, an optimist, if you will.
                        <br><br>
                        The Wright brothers had a dream that at the time, was probably one of the most ridiculous things people had ever heard. <q>You want to do what!? Fly like a bird? Well good luck with that…</q>. I’m sure they were ridiculed to no end.
                        <br><br>
                        As Arthur Schopenhauer, a German philosopher, said of any new idea <q>…First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.</q>
                        <br><br>
                        Every invention, every revolution whether scientific or religious and every dream that was just too big for society to handle was first met with ridicule. Whether it was out of jealously that other people dared to risk failure, or simply ignorance, I have no idea.
                        <br><br>
                        The truth holds; society can’t stand for you to dream great dreams. We’re taught to be <q>realistic</q>, to play it safe. Failure is made out to be the end of the world, and our already natural fear of failure is fed until we’re too afraid to even try.
                        <br><br>
                        When I was a kid I had a dream.
                        <br><br>
                        I wanted to draft into the Israeli army, and join an elite counter terrorism unit. But like you, I had one huge fear. It terrified me so much that I refused to tell anyone what my dream was. I was sure that as soon as I told people my dream they would laugh at me and just like that it would become impossible to achieve.
                        <br><br>
                        No one likes getting laughed at. They’d tell me things like <q>don’t be silly, that’s way too hard for you</q>. All the adults would give me that tolerant grin that says <q>isn’t he cute, he still has such huge aspirations</q>.
                        <br><br>
                        So I kept my dream a secret, and with time, I slowly started to believe that they were right, my dream was too big. Then, when the day of the tryout arrived, that uncertainty, that fear of reaching too high had seeped so deep into subconscious that I doubted myself.
                        <br><br>
                        That’s what years of realism has done to us; made us too scared to try, to dream, to soar.
                        <br><br>
                        Here’s the trick to breaking out of society’s mold, and freeing yourself to achieve whatever you aspire to:
                        <br><br>
                        1. <strong><em>Adopt confidence as a way of life.</em></strong>
                        <br><br>
                        Obviously I don’t mean over the top over-confidence, but a good healthy dose of confidence is just what the doctor orders for getting past the <q>realistic</q> mindset.
                        <br><br>
                        There are two ways I recommend building confidence. The first is a little harder, but lays the foundation for a confident life. Every day set aside five minutes for some introspection.
                        <br><br>
                        Write down a list of things you’ve done that day that have made a difference in someone else’s life. Come up with two positive attributes that make you stand out from the crowd. The fact that you’re aspiring to greatness and not conforming already means you’re a step ahead. That alone should bring you confidence.
                        <br><br>
                        The second step is to constantly be coming up with new ideas. As James Altucher explains in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Choose-Yourself-James-Altucher-audiobook/dp/B00D41EIPU/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Choose+yourself&qid=1607793344&sr=8-1"><u>Choose Yourself</u></a>, few people are naturally gifted with the ability to constantly come up with new ideas. The rest of us have to practice. Write another list of five new ideas that are possible, but still dreamlike. Figure out a way to implement each of those, and you’ve already proven to everyone that even the biggest dream is achievable.
                        <br><br>
                        There is no such thing as a dream that is too big, only a dreamer who who believes himself too small to try.
                        <br><br>
                        2. <strong><em>Don’t be afraid to tell people your dreams.</em></strong>
                        <br><br>
                        In fact, tell everyone you meet.
                        <br><br>
                        Friends, family, teachers and even strangers on the street. The worst thing that could happen is that they laugh at you. Sad for them, if they can’t open their mind enough to think the way you do, but at least you brought laughter into the world. Laughter is the secret to world peace. If everyone was able to laugh together, we’d quickly realize how much we have in common.
                        <br><br>
                        Now here’s the best case scenario. Every person you tell can help you actualize your dream in some way (and that’s a whole blog in and of itself) but by describing it repeatedly to different people, you’ll not only notice the flaws, you’ll also build your own confidence and excitement about the idea with each telling.
                        <br><br>
                        Ignore those people who try to tell you you’re aiming too high. You can never aim too high, if you’re no longer afraid of falling. And why be afraid of falling? It’s only through our mistakes that we learn where to improve.
                        <br><br>
                        Now go on, dream big! Take chances. Ignore anyone who tells you <q>you can’t</q>, <q>you shouldn’t</q> or <q>it’s not possible</q>. Defy realism and you WILL do great things.
                        <br><br>
                        Do you believe in yourself yet? I certainly do.
                        <br><br>
