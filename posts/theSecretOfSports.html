                        What’s so great about sports? It’s just a bunch of guys getting worked up over a game..
                        <br><br>
                        Right.
                        <br><br>
                        That’s what people who don’t get sports will tell you. Usually it’s your wife, your girlfriend, or your little sister who wants you out of the way so she can watch American Idol. Or whatever is girls watch these days.
                        <br><br>
                        Some people just don’t get what sports are about. It’s the challenge of going up against a good opponent and being pushed to your very limit. It’s the adrenaline pumping through your veins giving you just enough energy to catch him before he reaches the endzone. It’s the thrill of winning it all.

                        It’s all that and more.
                        <br><br>
                        See there’s something about sports that you may have never noticed.
                        <br><br>
                        Every time you go out there onto the field, the rink, the pitch, the court or wherever it is you play, something incredible happens. And if you’re not looking for it, then you’ve probably never seen it.
                        <br><br>
                        You see, when you’re out there, giving it your all, or not as the case may be, you give those around you a glimpse of the real you. In the game there are no fake smiles, no false laughs and no hiding who you are.
                        <br><br>
                        In a pick up game, where there are no stakes, you learn the most about those you play with. No one there has any particular reason to try, no reason to give every bit of his energy until he collapses on the bench at the game’s end and certainly no reason to cheat in order to win. Yet people still try hard, still cheat, or play fairly or give up.
                        <br><br>
                        Something about sports, more than regular games, brings out the real you. If you’re hard working, you’ll give it your all in the game. A persistent person plays until the buzzer sounds, even if it seems like the game is already lost.
                        <br><br>
                        It goes both ways. The way you play the game is often the way you are in real life. A player who cheats without hesitation, doing anything to get the win, is going to be the same person who will cheat you in business. When you don’t pass the ball to a team mate, it’s pretty clear that you’re not going to work with him on the project you’ve been assigned to get done together.
                        <br><br>
                        Last night I went to play basketball with some guys in the neighborhood. Both because I love to play, and because I was way too lazy to get my exercise by going for a run. Out of the 15 or so guys who were there, there was only one guy who I knew from beforehand, and even him not so well.
                        <br><br>
                        The longer we played, the more I learned about the guys I played with. Who plays until the last, who panics when he’s under pressure, which guy worked well with his team setting up the open guy for the shot, and which guys played just as hard on defense when they had nothing to gain for themselves, but playing hard nonetheless so that their team got the win.
                        <br><br>
                        Then, in one of the later games, I got the ball passed to me. I took a step toward the net and, realizing that there was a guy right on top of me, dropped the ball to dribble away. I dribbled, he touched the ball, the other team called it travelling.
                        <br><br>
                        Who was right you ask? It doesn’t matter. What matters is what I learned about the guys I was playing with. One guy argued that the ball was theirs, another got annoyed and came to ask me what happened. “You see?” he told the other players “it’s our ball!” Then there were those like me, who said “it’s your ball, now let’s keep playing”. For them, the game was just a game. They weren’t there to win or lose, they just wanted to play.
                        <br><br>
                        Those guys are the kind of people I want around me in life. They know the difference between what’s important, and what isn’t worth getting worked up over. They play fair, because their values are more important than winning. They play hard, because that’s the way they live their life, giving their all in everything they do.
                        <br><br>
                        They, like all of us, play sports the way they live their lives.
                        <br><br>
                        Maybe if I try hard enough, I’ll be able to live my life like I play sports. It’s certainly a lot easier to control the way I play than the way I live my life. Especially since the stakes are a lot lower. I’ll play hard so I can work hard. I’ll never give up, so that each failure in my life will give me a chance to improve myself. I’ll put sportsmanship before everything else, and hope that honesty and good nature fills everything I do.
                        <br><br>
                        I’ll start on the court, and see where my life goes from there.
